2. **Order Input**: It allows the user to input what they would like to order from a list of available items.
3. **Simple Arithmetic Operations**: The program performs and displays results of several arithmetic expressions.
4. **User Value Display**: It prompts the user for a value and displays it.
5. **Number Comparison**: It takes two numbers from the user and displays them in ascending order and also shows the larger number.
6. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of two user-provided numbers.
7. **Number Conversion**: It converts a number written in words (e.g., "ONE") to its numeric form.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Enter Your Name

The program starts by prompting the user to enter their name. If the user does not provide a name, it defaults to "Stranger".

### Step 2: Enter Your Gender

The user is prompted to enter their gender. The input should be either "male" or "female". If the input is invalid, the user is asked to re-enter the gender.

### Step 3: Order Details

The user is prompted to choose what they would like to order from a list of available items (Donuts, Coffee, Ice Cream, or Bakery) and then specify the particular item they want to order. The program then displays a message that the order is being prepared.

### Step 4: Arithmetic Operations

The program evaluates and logs the following expressions:

- Multiplication of -5 and 3
- Concatenation of "JavaScript" and 50
- Modulus of 17 by 5
- Division of 5 by 10
- Comparison of 4 and "4" for strict equality
- Comparison of 4 and 5 for inequality
- Comparison of 7 and 8 for less than or equal
- Concatenation of "Hello" and 5
- Difference between the ceiling and floor of 5.5
- Square of 5.5

### Step 5: Display User Value

The program prompts the user to enter a value and displays it using an alert.

### Step 6: Compare Two Numbers

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and displays them in ascending order. It also displays the larger of the two numbers in a separate prompt.

### Step 7: Sum of Two Numbers

The user is prompted to enter two numbers, and the program calculates and displays their sum.

### Step 8: Convert Number in Words to Numeric Form

The program converts a number written in words (e.g., "ONE") to its numeric form using a switch statement. If the input is invalid, it asks the user to try again.
